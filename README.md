## Features

- Run `!mn speedtest` command to check your internet speed from the botâ€™s machine.
- Replies with download/upload speeds and ping times.

- You will need to create a discord bot yourself and add it to your server.
- This is for anyone in the server to check *your* internet speed, not theirs.
